/*
 * CARS ~ 35 Points
 * 
 * Implement a class Car which contains the fields:
 * 		make | model | year | MPG | milesDriven | fuelCapacity | fuelRemaining
 * 
 * Implement at least the following methods within the Car class
 * 
 * 	-A constructor which initializes each field
 * 	-fillTank(double g) which adds up to g gallons but not exceeding capacity
 * 	-drive(double m) simulating driving m miles in the car, adding to total distance and reduces gas according
 * 	 to the cars MPG
 *  -toString ( ) which returns a String representation of the car
 *  -getFuelRemaining( ), which returns the amount of fuel left in the tank
 *  
 * CARS EXAMPLE
 *   Car oldJunker = new Car("Ford", "Pinto", 1972, 17.5, 12, 8); // creates a new Car object
 *   oldJunker.drive(5); // drives the Car 5 miles
 *   oldJunker.fillTank(1); // put in a gallon of gas
 *   System.out.println(oldJunker.getFuelRemaining()); // prints the amount of fuel left
 *   System.out.println(oldJunker); // prints the attributes of the car to the screen
 *
 *Write a short driver program to test your Car class with a short array of Cars.
